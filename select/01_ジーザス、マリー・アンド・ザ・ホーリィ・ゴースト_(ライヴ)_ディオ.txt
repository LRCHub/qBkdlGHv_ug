Prime time nursery rhyme
Did you see the teacher
Sister black and white
What she's gonna to do
They say eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
But don't hurt your brother
Cross road overload
Oh I I testify they just showed me Mary
She was stoned stoned danger zone
There was nothing in her eyes
And then there there in the
Air nailed to the cross was Jesus
Cross road overload
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray my soul to keep away
From the holy spirit holy ghost
They're hiding in the dark
Oh nightmare electric chair
You might not get to heaven
Bad boys shout for joy
Watch him to cry
Prime time nursery rhyme
Love just needs religion
Cross road overload
